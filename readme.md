### Extreme Climate Change In The US

>I created this map to support an article by the Washington Post labeled “2°C: Beyond the limit, Extreme climate change has arrived in America.” (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/climate-environment/climate-change-america/) The web map achieves this by showing concrete temperature data on the United States between the years 1925 and 2025. This web map displays state-level temperature data for each us state for the years 1925, 1985, and 2025. These years can be swapped between using a layer control box. Only one of these can be selected at once. The map also displays the temperature change between 1925 and 2025 when hovering over individual states. This ties in well with the theme of the map, which is extreme climate change in the United States. The web map includes common elements like a scale bar, north arrow, and legend. It also has many interactive elements, like clicking on a state zooms to it, or clicking the more info box displays a text box giving background on the map. There is also basic interactivity like zooming and panning, though I put limits on the zooming to keep the map reader on the scale I want them to see. The temperature data is from NOAA, and the state polygons are from the US Census Bureau.
